The day 1 of Bob's surviving journey, he went to fridge to bring up some food and eat his dinner, he taste the food and "VOILA" he found some weird taste there (maybe cheese is rotten?), he gave up eating and told himself "Hey Bob! you are 17 years old, i should be able to care my responsiblity by now", but hey. Bob never tried to cook something in his entire life, even his best food never have asked his mom about its name!
Bob trying hard and start thinking very deep to not bother his parents. AND finally he remembers his skills in internet surfing that said : "why don't i try searching for a what i have and cook what i can find?"

CONTENT :
RECIPEDIA is a website that used to suggest recipes for you, depends on **nutrients** you are targetting, **ingredients** you have or even **cuisine** 
the website is calling api to spoonacular website and get the recipes/autocompletion depends on your switch selections
the nutrients don't have auto complete feature
easy auto complete makes easier to explore new foods and recipes user may like :D
there will be also an automation file called `run.sh` use `sudo ./run.sh` to run the localhost faster

Future Updates :
there is nothing to do with database.db, my project doesn't depend on it yet
i use bootstrap and fontawesome for frontend design
there will be also another page in my website called /recipes whenever you visit you will be able to explore random recipes for each visit
user can be able to mark his favorite food to save them for later by using local storage or cache, maybe i need to make a signing page and data base
recipe cards will display differ on hover allowing you to see more details about the recipe and when clicking on it it will display new page that shows the card of the recipe
